README ABOUT THE PROJECT

This web-store example project was created as a project exercise during ICT-Camp training organized by Bear-IT. The aim of the training and project was to develop and showcase the development and programming skills of the persons who were involved in the project. 

The project team consisted of 6 people who had various different amounts of experience with web-development and group projects. The ICT-camp training also featured self-learning about the different tools and skills which were utilized in the project on top of other ICT-field related assignments.

The project was done using SCRUM agile project development model within four weeks and it consisted of two sprints which lasted for two weeks each. The web-store visual designs and navigations were created in Figma and Miro which were then ultimately implemented into the project following the designs.

The aim was to create a web-store prototype that would allow the team to develop and test the React javascript front-end development framework and node.js back-end with the aid of Vite and Prisma development tools. The project has been created to run only in local test demo environment and it is not planned to be published or hosted on the web.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
